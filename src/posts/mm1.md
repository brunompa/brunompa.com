Jumping straight into game development and progress, I'll introduce and write about the game and what all this is about in the next monday materials but for now I want to get work out instead.

T-minus 2 weeks and 4 days until I post about the game on reddit, theres multiple functionalities missing and I've put myself the goal to post for feedback for the last couple of weeks, so this is a way to also keep me accountable, the missing features and bugs are somewhat game breaking which doesn't allow me to just post what I got at the moment, there will be some functionalities missing by the time I post on reddit but I hope that I can get some feedback and end up polishing and correcting the game to a stable state.

The worst non breaking game part at the moment is the balancing, theres no a real organization or sense in the game progression values, I just kept throwing numbers at it while I was developing and hoping that they wouldn't be too outlandish.

I'll go in depth on each game functionality on each monday material, teaching you about the game and the reasons that made to make such choices and not others.

### Bank

Right now I'm working on the bank expanding feature allowing the player to see check how many times their investment has capitalized on, also thinking about ways to expand the invesment tab.

### Shipyard / Port

- This image is from the old shipyard that is now the Port interface.

While that I've been working on the shipyard and port differences, functionalities and UI making the shipyard for buying and building boats and the port to manage their state.

- This is the new shipyard interface where im currently working on, where the player will buy and build new boats.

I wish to work on the betting page in the coming weeks since I foresee a lot of work coming from it.
But it is also a really confusing and outline logic to program and plan so I keep kicking the can down the road.

I don't have much time before the reddit post is made so every progress I can make better be important and focused, see you next week with new info and new developemnts (I hope).
