The reddit comment was made last friday, we got 4 comments, at least 100 visits in the first 24 hours and its way more than I reallisticly expected. All of the comments had usefull feedback and suggestions to improve the game, most of them have already been implemented but still need some time to finish the others, I fixed almost all the bugs and corrections that I wanted before publishing but couldn't actually do them all, ended up being happy with what I got and super happy with the response, I'll see what kind of progress I can get done this week and if theres new additions or complete changes might post again this week if not will post again once I feel like it's more stable and all feedback given has been addressed.

Since the last post I worked on the buildings I talked about and on the feedback given, this week I won't talk about any building in particular, will leave you with the reddit post with the comment and the game link if you want to see or try the game yourself and provide feedback has well.
