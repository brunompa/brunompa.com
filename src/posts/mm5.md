Since the last time I haven't honestly gotten any progress, a mixture of personal life and work didn't leave me much time to spend programming, I didn't want to just leave you with nothing so I decided to at least update you guys, I hope I don't repeat myself next week and actually put some time into development this week, I know what needs too be do and how to do it, I just need the time to actually do it.

Since the last post we got another comment on our comment, just a person commenting on how they like the design but it felt nice, and has I said, since I didn't get any progress done I didn't post on on feedback friday last week, will aim to do so this week or at the latest next one.
